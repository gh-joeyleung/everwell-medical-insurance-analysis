# Insights Summary

**Signup Rate**
- Across campaign categories, Health for All campaigns had the best-performing signup rate (2%) and the second-highest number of signups (3.5K).
- This high signup rate is due to the Health Awareness campaign type, which had by far the highest signup rate across all campaign types (2.8%).
- Interestingly, the category with the highest number of signups - #HealthyLiving - had a comparably low signup rate at 0.3%.

**Click through Rate**
- Across categories, Health for All and Benefit Updates performed nearly 3x better than the average CTR at 25% and 22%, respectively.
- Within the two categories with high CTR, phealth awareness-based campaigns were the sole contributor CTR (37% and 31%).
- Family Coverage Plan had high impressions but no clicks - this needs to be investigated and could be due to missing data or issues with the campaign.

**Cost per Signup**
- Across campaign categories, Golden Years Security had by far the highest cost per signup ($178), as well as the lowest number of signups (23), compared to an average of $3.7.
- Within the two campaign categories with highest cost per signup, info-based campaign types (like offers and policy info) drove high costs per signup.
- Health Awareness campaign of Summer Wellness Tips had a cost per signup of $939 with only 2 signups.

# Recommendations
- **Budget Reallocation:** Reallocate budget from Golden Years Security, which has high cost per acquisition, to Health for All campaigns. The second category outperforms across all key metrics, yet we have invested a relatively low amount ($20K) on them.
- **Campaign Type:** For Summer Wellness Tips, focus more on policy information and less on health awareness-type marketing, which had low signup rate and high cost per signup. Consider removing these campaigns.
- **Marketing Channels:** Although social and referral had the highest number of impressions (7M), email had the highest CTR (15%) and the lowest CPC ($0.03). Consider increasing the campaigns sent via email.
- **#HealthyLiving:** Decrease investment in this campaign category, which has the highest spend ($46K) but mediocre signup rates compared to Health for All campaigns.
